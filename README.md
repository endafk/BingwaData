## Features

- **Purchase Bundles:**  
  Select a bundle and purchase it via a modal interface.
- **Clean Response Display:**

  View a log of all purchase transactions on the History tab.
- **Dark Mode / Theming:**  
  Toggle between light and dark themes using a switch in the global header.
- **Custom Bottom Tab Navigator:**  
  Rounded tab bar with Ionicons for each tab.
- **Error Handling:**  
  An Error Boundary catches unexpected errors.

## Getting Started

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```
This command will move the starter code to the app-example directory and create a blank app directory where you can start developing.

## Installation
Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/endafk/BingwaData
cd BingwaData
```
##Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```


## API Configuration

This app uses a sample API endpoint for handling bundle purchases. The current endpoint is hard-coded as:

```js
const response = await fetch('https://api.bingwasokoni.lore/api/bundle.php', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8' },
  body: JSON.stringify(payload),
});
```

To use your own API, follow these steps:

- Locate the API Call:

Open index.tsx (or the file where handlePurchaseBundle is defined) and find the fetch call shown above.

- Replace the URL:

Change the URL (https://api.bingwasokoni.lore/api/purchases.php) to your own endpoint.

- Verify the Payload Structure:

The app sends a JSON payload with the following fields:
```JSON
user_id: (number) Your user's unique identifier.
offer_amount: (number) The bundle amount (extracted from the bundle price).
phone_number: (string) The phone number that will receive the bundle.
mpesa_phone: (string) The phone number associated with mobile money (M-Pesa).
offer_ussd: (string) A USSD code used for the bundle (optional based on your API).
action: "purchase_bundle" – This specifies the type of request.
```
- Adjust the payload if your API requires different fields.

- Handle the Response:
The app currently expects a JSON response containing at least a status field (e.g., { "status": "Purchase Successful, You will be prompted to enter your Mpesa PIN" }).

If your API returns a different structure, update the response parsing logic in handlePurchaseBundle accordingly.

- Test Your Endpoint:
Once you update the API URL and payload (if necessary), test your changes locally by running:

```bash
npx expo start
```

and attempting a purchase to ensure that the app communicates properly with your API.

By following these steps, you can easily replace the sample API with your own without affecting the rest of the app's functionality.


## Running the App

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npx expo start
```

Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code, or run the app on an iOS/Android simulator.
Building for Production
Expo’s EAS (Expo Application Services) makes it easy to build production-ready apps:

## Install EAS CLI (if not already installed):

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

## Log in to Expo:

```bash
eas login
```
## Configure Your Project:

```bash
eas build:configure
```

## Build Your App:

For Android:
```bash
eas build --platform android
```
For iOS:
```bash
eas build --platform ios
```
Follow the prompts to complete your build. Once finished, you'll receive a URL to download your APK/IPA.

## Project Structure
   - AppNavigator.js:
